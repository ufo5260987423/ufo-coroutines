# Overview

This package is a dependable coroutine package for chez scheme. I hacked chez-a-sync(https://github.com/ChrisVine/chez-a-sync) and simplified it. And my purpose is making this library easily imported into other code.

This package is published with Akku(https://akkuscm.org/), which is a language package manager for Scheme. 

This package has been tested with Chez Scheme versions 9.4 and 9.5.
